### My experience 👨🏼‍💻

- As a software developer, I have a strong background in working with technologies such as PHP7 and PHP8, MySQL, Symfony 3 and 4, Slim3 and Slim4, and Docker, as well as AWS services, GO lang, Jenkins, and Git for code review and deployment.

- I am committed to using best coding practices and standards, such as SOLID principles, KISS, DDD, DI, and design patterns, to ensure high-quality code.
- Additionally, I adhere to the testing pyramid and use tools such as Behat and PHPUnit to test my code.

Currently, I am focused on improving my skills in areas such as architecture, design, scalability, efficiency, deployability, and testability.
