# Hi friend! 👋

I am Diar, I'm thrilled that you are here and I would love if we could get in touch.

- If you are an experienced developer then write me a "Hi" and I will write you back, maybe we can end up doing something cool together.
- If you are just getting started into development world then I encourage you to say "Hi"
  I could give you some tips for your career or even help you land your first job.
- Last but not least, if you are neither of the above then I would still love to hear from you, I am also looking to just expand my connections.

# My experience 👨🏼‍💻

- I have a strong background in working with technologies such as PHP7 and PHP8, MySQL, Symfony 3 and 4, Slim3 and Slim4, and Docker, as well as AWS services, GO lang, Jenkins, and Git for code review and deployment.
- I am committed to using best coding practices and standards, such as SOLID principles, KISS, DDD, DI, and design patterns, to ensure high-quality code.
- Additionally, I adhere to the testing pyramid and use tools such as Behat and PHPUnit to test my code.

Currently, I am focused on improving my skills in areas such as architecture, design, scalability, efficiency, deployability, and testability.
