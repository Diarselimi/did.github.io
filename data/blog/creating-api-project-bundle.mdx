# Before we start

This is a series of articles where you are going to see how to create an API which interacts with other API's,
this is going to be production ready so you could use this application directly into your frontend or mobile app.

# Project idea

The project that I want to do in this series is a api software where I am going to explain using [C4 model](https://c4model.com/),
before going into diagrams I want to give you some context of what I want to achieve.

I want to have an API which analyses a list of articles where we are going to get them from [api.dev.to/articles](),
and from these we are going to analyse and see what kind of keyword they contain also which tags.

After gathering these data we want to create a list of most used keywords, this should be the main basic functionality.
For this API we are going to use Github Oauth2 for authenticating.

## System Context Diagram

Before I tell you what are you going to learn, you need to know that this article will group together articles are part of the same project.
In this case I am starting to write a boundle articles where we are going to create an API from scratch all the way to deployment.
