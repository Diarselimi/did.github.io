### The Env library

The goal of this library is to be able to load Environment variable values into GO structs.
There are plenty of go libraries out there which cover a lot of edge cases, this one is a simple one where it loads three types of values

1. String
2. Int to Int64
3. Float32 and Float64
4. Bool

### Installation

If you have already set up your project in GO and you want to install the lib, then all you need to do is
`go get github.com/diarselimi/dev` and that's it.

### Basic Usage

After installing this library you can simply use it by importing it and passing the struct by reference.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/Diarselimi/env"
)

type ClientConfig struct {
    BaseUrl string `env:"API_BASE_URL"`
    ClientId string `env:"API_CLIENT_ID"`
    Secret string `env:"API_SECRET"`
}

func main() {
    config := ClientConfig{}
    env.PopulateWithEnv(&config)

    fmt.Println(config)
}
```

Output would look something like the following

```output
{https://api.example.com/v1/ some_client_id secret}
```
