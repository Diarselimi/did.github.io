# Before we start

If you are not aware of [the first part](https://diar.dev/blog/creating-api-project-bundle) of this project,
please check that first so that what we are doing here makes sense.

I am going to create a repository called `keyword-analyser`, based on the template I published before.

This is the [template repository](https://github.com/didslm/nginx-php-skeleton).
If you are not sure just checkout [this short video](https://youtu.be/dPNvOXmBdYc) how to do it.

# Choosing a framework

I am going to choose [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) for our project here, I will use the API skeleton using composer.

```terminal
composer create-project symfony/skeleton:"6.2.*" app && \
cp -r app/* . && rm -r app
```

There are other frameworks that you can choose from like:

- Laravel
- Cake PHP
- Yii

# Pushing your code

Now since we have the project ready for our repository, using git we are going to push the code to our private repository.
Assuming you already cloned the skeleton repository into your machine, the following is to do your first commit.

Let's execute

```terminal
git add .
git commit -m "Symfony initialization commit"
git push
```

We can have a file with the following content to tell git which directories and files to ignore

```txt:.gitignore
vendor
.DS_Store
.idea
var/cache
```

# Adding a ping endpoint

The following controller is located inside `src > Controller` directory.

```php:PingController.php
<?php

namespace App\Controller;

use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\JsonResponse;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Request;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;

class PingController
{
    #[Route('/v1/ping')]
    public function Ping(Request $request) : JsonResponse
    {
        return new JsonResponse(['ping' => true]);
    }
}
```

# See the result

You can spin up the instance by running the following

```output
make up
```

and you can access the endpoint on [localhost:8000/v1/ping](http://localhost:8000/v1/ping).

Here you can [see the result I pushed into Github](https://github.com/didslm/keyword-analyser).

# Adding Tests

Next step we are going to add a Functional test checking if we are getting the correct response from this Controller.

First we need to install library for testing, in this case we need one that integrates easily with symfony.

```output
composer require --dev symfony/test-pack
```

And the test class would look like this

```php:PingControllerTest.php
<?php

namespace App\Tests\Application;

use Symfony\Bundle\FrameworkBundle\Test\WebTestCase;


class PingControllerTest extends WebTestCase
{
    public function testShouldSucceed()
    {
        $client = static::createClient();

        // Request a specific page
        $client->request('GET', '/v1/ping');

        $response = $client->getResponse()->getContent();

        // Validate a successful response and some content
        $this->assertResponseIsSuccessful();
        $this->assertEquals(['ping' => true], json_decode($response, true));

    }
}
```

# Summary

In this article we learned how to start an application using a framework, host it in github and run our tests in github pipelines.

Things that we learned.

- How we can use the prepared template to containerise our PHP application using Docker.
- How to create a new Symfony API endpoint.
- How to push our project using GIT and Github for hosting our code.
- How to add Application tests using one of the Symfony's library.
