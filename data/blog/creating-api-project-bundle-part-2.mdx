# What do you need

Before we start coding you need to have docker installed in your machine, and Git for pushing your code.

- To install docker you [should download it from their page](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- To install git you can download from [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

After you are done installing docker you should be able to run in your terminal

```terminal
git -v
```

and docker-compose

```terminal
docker-compose version
```

That's all, next step is to go to this [template repository](https://github.com/didslm/nginx-php-skeleton) and use it for our project
to create a new project called `keyword-analyser`.

# Choosing a framework

I am going to choose symfony for our project here, since it has some things for us ready.
