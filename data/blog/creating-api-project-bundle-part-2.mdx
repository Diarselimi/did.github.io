# Before we start

Before we start coding you need to have docker installed in your machine, Git for pushing your code and Composer.

- To install docker you [should download it from their page](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- To install git you can download from [this link](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- To install Composer you can [download it here](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

After you are done installing docker you should be able to run in your terminal

```terminal
git -v
```
and docker-compose

```terminal
docker-compose version
```

That's all, next step is to go to this [template repository](https://github.com/didslm/nginx-php-skeleton) and use it for our project
to create a new project called `keyword-analyser`.

# Choosing a framework

I am going to choose symfony for our project here, I will use the API skeleton using composer.
```terminal
composer create-project symfony/skeleton:"6.2.*" app
cd app && composer install phpunit/phpunit @dev
```

# Pushing your code

Now since we have the project ready for our repository, using git we are going to push the code to our private repository.
Assuming you already cloned the skeleton repository into your machine, the following is to do your first commit.

Let's execute
```terminal
git status #to see which files are added
git add .
git commit -m "Symfony initialization commit"
```

We can have a file with the following content to tell git which directories and files to ignore
```txt:.gitignore
vendor
.DS_Store
```


# See the result
After installing the composer symfony skeleton, you can spin up the instance by running `make up`,
and you can access the endpoints on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/).


# Next step
Now that you are all set up,
let's get our project going by adding some endpoints to it, but before adding endpoints we need to take a look at our c4 model.
